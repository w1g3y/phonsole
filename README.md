# phonsole

phonsole is a set of tiny functions to manage lines, titles, text alignment and 
colours for php-powered command line apps.

There are no dependencies - other than PHP-CLI, and a recent Linux/BSD with
the `stty -a` command that will return rows and cols of a terminal window.

It's not neatly written.

It's not OOP.

There's no classes.

There's no documentation.

But it's tiny, so have fun.
